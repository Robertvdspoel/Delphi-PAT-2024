THE GYM MEMBERSHIP

This was my IT PAT for 2024. The theme was healthy living. The language used was Delphi.

The gym membership is a program designed to help people live healthier. It does this by allowing the ones that are members to earn points on activities and then export those points to other platform which will likely also help them live healthier For example: Woolworths that can sell them healthy food. 
The more effort a user puts into an activity, the more points they will earn. The more often the user visits the gym and does activities, the more points they will earn.
